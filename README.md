Please clone my repo and run the scala file in the location: src/main/scala/Main.scala

This will produce four outputs in the console with my answers.

I am new to Java and Scala so please be mindful of that with my code, I have tried to use functional programming where I understand it but do appreciate gaps where I have mutated values.
